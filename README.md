# Flap
Passion Project

Console-based, multi-player, Snake clone. Previously a Flappy Bird clone, but the movement doesn't look right in the console. Should've thought about this earlier.

This project is for learning new techniques and showcasing my knowledge of: architecture; concurrency/parallelism; game logic, and networking.
